A WordPress Plugin that implements user shadowbanning
by Another Cup of Coffee Limited


FeenBan is a simple WordPress plugin that implements user shadowbanning/hellbanning for comments. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellbanning)

Post comments by shadowbanned users will be invisible to all other users. However, the shadowbanned users will continue to see their own comments, therefore hopefully being oblivious to the fact that they've been shadowbanned. This is a non-destructive in that changes are not made to the comments themselves. Shadowbanned comments are still saved to the database and visible to admins in the dashboard comments listing. All that happens is that a 'shadowban' flag is set in the user metadata. If you disable this plugin, showbanned comments will become visible to all users.
